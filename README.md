🌍 KindNet / Need2Feed
Connecting Surplus to Need – Reducing Waste, Changing Lives

A digital platform designed to connect donors, NGOs, and vulnerable communities (orphanages, old-age homes, needy individuals) to ensure that surplus resources reach the right people at the right time.

Existing systems are:
❌ Unorganized
❌ Lack transparency
